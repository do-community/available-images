## Development/Building

To setup the build/develop environment, you will need to run `npm i` with Node 12+ installed. This will install the
 dependencies to allow you to build the project.
 
To build or develop this tool, you will need to create a DigitalOcean API key. To do this, sign into the DigitalOcean
 control panel, click "API" in the sidebar and click "Generate New Token" on the screen which appears. Simply create a
 read-only token, copy `config.example.js` to a new file called `config.js` and insert your token in this file.

The scripts that use this token also support an environment variable instead of the config file, set the environment
 variable `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN` to the token and remove the `config.js` file to use this method instead.

To develop for this tool run `npm run dev`.
This will start a development server that will automatically reload the codebase when changes occur.

If you wish to host this tool on a service, simply run `npm run build`. This will run all the necessary build scripts
 automatically to build the tool.\
You can then take the `dist` folder and put it on your web server/bucket.

GitHub Actions is setup to do this automatically for this repository to deploy to gh-pages.

## Source Structure

### [`src/available-images`](./src/available-images)

#### [`src/available-images/scss`](./src/available-images/scss)

The scss directory contains the main SCSS styling file for the tool, which imports our do-bulma library and then adds
 tool-specific customisations.

#### [`src/available-images/templates`](./src/available-images/templates)

This directory contains the Vue templates that are used to render the tool on the client-side.
`app.vue` is the main Vue file that other templates are referenced into.

#### [`src/available-images/utils`](./src/available-images/utils)

Utility functions that are used by the tool live inside this directory.

### [`src/build`](./src/build)

The build directory contains a special utility script that is used during the initial build of the tool both for
 deployments and in development. This script uses the provided DigitalOcean API key and fetches all images,
 saving them to local JSON files that the tool then uses.
